Teflon Don,Rick Ross,20-Jul-10,"Losing none of the momentum put in motion by his 2009 effort, Deeper Than Rap, Rick Ross keeps a very good thing going on Teflon Don, arguably his best album to date. You want rap-style luxury? Then Deeper is the better fit, but Teflon plays up the chilled and soulful elements of its predecessor, meaning Ross has graduated to a level where words like â€œorganicâ€ and â€œpoignantâ€ come into play. The former is best represented by â€œMayback Music IIIâ€ and itâ€™s swirling, â€˜70s-flavored dreamscape created by the J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League production team. Ross allows guests T.I. and Jadakiss to go first on the cut, then grabs his cigar for an uplifting story of ghetto triumph that goes from pushing to pleasing the folks (â€œParents never had a good job/Now itâ€™s black American Express cards""). When it comes to â€œpoignant,â€ the evidence is dotted throughout the album with the rapper reflecting on where heâ€™s been, and he often questions his own lust for fame. He chants the title to the opening â€œIâ€™m Not a Starâ€ as if it was a remindful mantra, but itâ€™s his new love of contrasts thatâ€™s really interesting, following Kanyeâ€™s swaggering on â€œLive Fast, Die Youngâ€ with â€œSeems to me we gettinâ€™ money for the wrong things/Look around, Maseratis for the whole team/Look at Haiti, children dyinâ€™ round the clock/Iâ€™d send a hundred grand but thatâ€™s a decent watchâ€. The familiar party and thugging tunes work too with â€œB.M.F. (Blowin' Money Fast),â€ â€œNo. 1,â€ and the mixtape favorite â€œMC Hammerâ€ -- now with added Gucci Mane verse -- all coming correct. Add all the Illuminati references in the Jay-Z team-up (â€œFree Masonâ€), a decent smoking song (â€œSuper Highâ€), and a track where Cee-Loâ€™s performance just might make you misty (â€œTears of Joyâ€), and itâ€™s obvious Rossâ€™ albums are no longer just vessels for his singles. ~ David Jeffries",79,8.8,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/music/2/9c3b949c5c555b8eb4ab92c270f96c60-98.jpg

Part II: The New December,The Booksman,22-Jun-10,"Fol Chen continues to embrace mystery and avoid the obvious on Part II: The New December. As on Part I: John Shade, Your Fortuneâ€™s Made, the enigmatic band makes a virtue out of indirectness, sending songs through secret passages and tunnels that end in hooks some distance from where they were expected. Thereâ€™s a strong experimental streak in the brainy way Fol Chen takes what seems like a straightforward idea and twists it into something completely different; like the Dirty Projectors, the group flirts with and subverts mainstream pop ideas, and like labelmates Cryptacize, theyâ€™ve got a flair for the deceptively simple. The band goes even further down the rabbit hole than on Part I, beginning The New December with some of its strangest music. â€œIn Ruinsâ€ contrasts deep, whispered vocals with lively girlish ones atop busy keyboards playing busy, vaguely Eastern-tinged melodies; â€œYour Curtain Callâ€ begins with breathy beats and woozy flutes, expanding into bells and a drunken sax solo before pulling back again; and â€œMen, Houses or Beastsâ€ tiptoes so slowly that it almost sounds like it was recorded at the wrong speed. Fittingly for a band so committed to disguising its identity, some of The New Decemberâ€™s best songs deal with miscommunication and missed connections. On â€œThe Holograms,â€ a tale of forgotten names and words doubling into optical illusions, bounces along on one of the albumâ€™s catchiest melodies, while the excellent â€œC/Uâ€ keeps its lovers apart despite its almost perversely straightforward beat. Likewise, the band buries some of its best songs on the albumâ€™s second half: â€œAdeline (You Always Look so Bored)â€â€™s sharp-tongued chamber pop recalls St. Vincentâ€™s abundant musical and lyrical wit, and â€œThey Came to Meâ€ boasts rubbery beats that are just as danceable as they are strange, and could be heard at a club with a trampoline for a dancefloor. How exactly these songs fit together with â€œHolesâ€â€™ delicate plucking and the title trackâ€™s pixelated folk might be locked in Fol Chenâ€™s brains, but even if there are more pieces of their puzzle-pop missing here than there were on John Shade, Your Fortuneâ€™s Made, The New December is never boring. ~ Heather Phares",78,7.1,https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/music/3/504a486a1e4706bc0f50eea766aa39f3-98.jpg
